/**
 * THE HANDOFF TOUR — three steps, at the one moment the ground moves.
 *
 * The handoff is the only point in the run where the user changes profile
 * without asking to: they were talking to Hermes on its own profile, and they
 * land mid-build in a session of their own. Nothing on screen says where the
 * welcome chat went, or that the sessions list they now see belongs to a
 * different profile than the one they were in a moment ago.
 *
 * The guide cannot narrate this itself: the tour bridge only paints for the
 * session the user is looking at, and after the handoff the guide is a
 * background session (desktop AGENTS.md: offer, don't hijack). So the app runs
 * the same three steps the guide would have asked for, in the user's language,
 * and the guide's one line in its own chat says nothing about them.
